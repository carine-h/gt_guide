Throughout this examples we'll use the trains data set which contains data from a Ryan D. Enos study ( \link{https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/renos/files/enostrains.pdf} ) that looks at the impact of intergroup contact on exclusionary attitudes. The Enos study is "a randomized controlled trial testing the causal effects of repeated intergroup contact, in which Spanish-speaking confederates were randomly assigned to be inserted, for a period of days, into the daily routines of unknowing Anglo-whites living in homogeneous communities in the United States, thus simulating the conditions of demographic change." Control and treatment subjects were polled before and after exposur to Spanish-speaking confederates to measure their change in attitude in regards to political issues that have to do with exclusionary attitudes. Using gt, we can present the Enos data in a clear, powerful way. 


knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# First you have to load in the desired libraries and package. gt will make use of tidyverse. 
library(tidyverse)

# install and load in gt:
# install.packages("gt")
library(gt)

# Make sure to have PPBDS.data installed and loaded in as well:
#remotes::install_github("davidkane9/PPBDS.data")
library(PPBDS.data)

# We'll be making use of the trains dataset in this example. This data set contains data from a Ryan D. Enos study ( \link{https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/renos/files/enostrains.pdf} ) that looks at the impact of intergroup contact on exclusionary attitudes.
trains

# Later we'll look at the change in attitude across treatment and control subjects. Here I create a variable for attitude change and update the dataset:
trains <- trains%>%
  mutate(att_chg = att_end - att_start)
  
  
  ## Summarizing the data 
Before making a gt table, it's always useful to summarize the data to get a sense of the data set. From this we see the columns are gender, liberal, party, age, income, att_start, treatment, and att_end. 
```{r}
summary(trains)
x <- trains %>%
  select(gender, income, att_end) %>%
  slice(1:5)
x


#Building the Table
Now that we have clean data, we'll want to display it in an attractive, clear way. 
- show what plain r output looks like 
- show what gt looks like 
- walk through steps of building the gt table 
    - GRAPHIC THAT SHOWS GT PARTS
