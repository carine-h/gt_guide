# Introduction

**gt** is a simple way to elegantly display your data and any summaries of your data. By now you're familiar with **ggplot**, another great way to display and summarize data. However, in many instances, tables are a more appropriate way to showcase data, especially when you need to provide exact figures in an easy-to-access format. 

First, we'll create a **gt** summary table of some observations from the data. Second, we'll runs a linear regression and display the outcome using **gtsummary**.

If you want to learn more about **gt** check our [this](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-16-gt-a-grammer-of-tables/) fantastic guide. [Here's](https://gt.rstudio.com) a link to the official **gt** package website. [Here's](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html) a helpful and extensive guide to **gtsummary**.

## Loading Libraries and Data

Here are the libraries needed to create **gt** and **gtsummary** tables.

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(PPBDS.data)
library(gt)
```

We set `message=FALSE` in the above code chunk to avoid showing all the ugly notes when these libraries are loaded.

# Building a table with data using **gt**

Now let's pull some data which we will use in our table: 

```{r basic data}
x <- trains %>%
  select(gender, income, att_end) %>%
  slice(1:5)
x
```

This is what the most basic `gt()` table will look like:

```{r basic gt}
x %>% 
  gt()
```

Now let's make this more professional. **gt** offers a variety of functions to add features like these^[source: https://gt.rstudio.com]: 

```{r gt graphic}
knitr::include_graphics("gt_features.png")
```

You can add a title and subtitle using the function `tab_header()`: 

```{r gt titles}
x %>% 
  gt()%>%
   tab_header(title = "Enos Data Observations", 
              subtitle = "Gender, Income, and End Attitude from the Trains Data")
```

By default, titles and other text can not be formatted. If you want formatting, you must wrap the character string in a call to `md()`, where *md* stands for (M)ark(d)own ([here's](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) some more info on R Markdown). For example, here is a bolded title.

```{r gt md formatting}
x %>% 
  gt()%>%
   tab_header(title = md("**Enos Data Observations**"), 
              subtitle = "Gender, Income, and End Attitude from the Trains Data")
```

You can neaten up the column names using `cols_label()`:

```{r gt labels}
x %>% 
  gt()%>%
    tab_header(title = md("**Enos Data Observations**"), 
               subtitle = "Gender, Income, and End Attitude from the Trains Data") %>%
    cols_label(gender = "Gender",
               income = "Income", 
               att_end = "End Attitude")
```

Use a `tab_source_note()` to cite the source of the data or to create a caption. This function is not exclusively for providing a source - though it's a handy way to do so - and can be used to display any text you'd like:

```{r gt tab source}
x %>% 
  gt()%>%
   tab_header(title = md("**Enos Data Observations**"), 
              subtitle = "Gender, Income, and End Attitude from the Trains Data") %>%
  cols_label(gender = "Gender",
             income = "Income", 
             att_end = "End Attitude") %>% 
  tab_source_note("Source: Ryan Enos")
```

Using `md()` again, we can italicize the name of the Enos study in the caption:

```{r gt md caption}
x %>% 
  gt()%>%
   tab_header(title = md("**Enos Data Observations**"), 
              subtitle = "Gender, Income, and End Attitude from the Trains Data") %>%
  cols_label(gender = "Gender",
             income = "Income", 
             att_end = "End Attitude") %>% 
  tab_source_note(md("Source: Ryan Enos, *Causal Effect of Intergroup Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes*"))
```


Now that the table structure looks good, we want to fix the contents. Let's add some dollar signs to the income column using `fmt_currency()`. This function also adds commas (if you want commas without dollar signs use `fmt_number()`). The `vars()` within `fmt_currency()` denotes the variable being formatted as a currency:

<!-- Explain the vars thing. Explain that a line return does not effect things in the md(). DONE? did I explain well? -->

```{r gt currency format}
x %>% 
  gt() %>%
    tab_header(title = md("**Enos Data Observations**"), 
               subtitle = "Gender, Income, and End Attitude from the Trains Data")%>%
    cols_label(gender = "Gender",
               income = "Income", 
               att_end = "End Attitude") %>% 
    tab_source_note(md("Source: Ryan Enos, *Causal Effect of Intergroup 
                       Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes*")) %>%
    fmt_currency(columns = vars(income), 
                 decimals = 0) 
```

Note that the line return in the title between "Intergroup" and "Contact" does not effect or break up the title displayed by `md()`.

# Presenting regression results with **gt** and **gtsummary**

There are a few ways to visualize regression results. The most basic way is using `print()`. Here is the result of a linear regression with `lm()` using `party` to model `att_end`:

```{r lm fit 1}
fit1 <- lm(att_end ~ party, data = trains)
print(fit1)
```

This gives us the info we need but doesn't look very nice. We can use **gtsummary** to create more professional visualizations. Put the regression into `tbl_regression()`:

```{r basic gtsummary table}
library(gtsummary)
tbl_regression(fit1) 
```

The table above is pretty basic: it only shows the coefficient for Republicans. But what about the intercept, Democrats? `tbl_regression()` with `intercept = TRUE` displays the intercept value:

```{r intercept gtsummary}
# to see intercept
tbl_regression(fit1, intercept = TRUE)

```


It would be nice to have a column for each party. We can do this using `tbl_summary()`:
BY = TRT and TITLES NOT WORKING 
https://github.com/ddsjoberg/gtsummary

To add titles, captions, and the like, we need to transform this graphic into a gt object using `as_gt()`:

```{r as gt in gtsummary}
tbl_regression(fit1, intercept = TRUE) %>%
  as_gt() 
  
```

Now we can add a title and subtitle using `tab_header()` just as we did with the **gt** example:

```{r gtsummary titles}
tbl_regression(fit1, intercept = TRUE) %>%
  as_gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = "Regression of Attitudes about Immigration", 
              subtitle = "The Effect of Party on End Attitude")
  
```

Now we can add a caption:

```{r gtsummary caption}
tbl_regression(fit1, intercept = TRUE) %>%
  as_gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = "Regression of Attitudes about Immigration", 
              subtitle = "The Effect of Party on End Attitude") %>%
  tab_source_note(md("Source: Ryan Enos, *Causal Effect of 
                     Intergroup Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes*"))
```

If you want to get rid of default footnotes, like that for the confidence interval, you can use `as_gt()`:

```{r gtsummary excluding footnotes}
tbl_regression(fit1, intercept = TRUE) %>%
  as_gt(include = -tab_footnote) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Regression of Attitudes about Immigration", 
              subtitle = "The Effect of Party on End Attitude") %>%
  tab_source_note(md("Source: Ryan Enos, *Causal Effect of 
                     Intergroup Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes*"))
```

You can also add footnotes to different cells in the table using `tab_footnote()`. This is a **gt** function that can be used on **gtsummary** tables thanks to the `as_gt()` function. Here we'll add a footnote to the p-value column using locations = `cells_column_labels()` to specify that the footnote is specifically meant for a column title. If you want to single out different locations for footnotes, here are more helpfer functions to be used within `tab_footnote()`: `cells_title()`, `cells_stubhead()`, `cells_column_spanners()`, `cells_row_groups()`, `cells_stub()`, `cells_body()`, `cells_summary()`, and `cells_grand_summary()`.

```{r gtsummary footnotes}
tbl_regression(fit1, intercept = TRUE) %>%
  as_gt(include = -tab_footnote) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Regression of Attitudes about Immigration", 
              subtitle = "The Effect of Party on End Attitude") %>%
  tab_source_note(md("Source: Ryan Enos, *Causal Effect of 
                     Intergroup Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes*")) %>% 
  tab_footnote( 
    footnote = "Calculated via a permutation test.",
    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = vars(p.value))
  )


```

We can making a **gt** table using a `stan_glm()` regression as well:

```{r gtsummary with stan_glm}
library(rstanarm)
library(broom.mixed)
fit2 <- stan_glm(att_end ~ party, data = trains, refresh = 0)

tbl_regression(fit2, intercept = TRUE) %>%
  as_gt() %>%
    tab_header(title = "Regression of Attitudes about Immigration", 
               subtitle = "The Effect of Party on End Attitude") %>%
    tab_source_note(md("Source: Ryan Enos, *Causal Effect of Intergroup 
                        Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes*"))
  
```
